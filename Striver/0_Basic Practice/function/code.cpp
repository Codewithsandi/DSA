//! Basic Function Questions 
//? 1. Write a function add that takes two integers and returns their sum. Use this function in the main function to add two numbers provided by the user.

//? 2. Write a function that swaps two numbers using pass by value. Explain why this does not work and then write a function that swaps two numbers using pass by reference.

//? 3. Write a function that calculates the power of a number. Use default arguments to make the exponent 2 if no value is provided.

//? 4. What is an inline function? Write an inline function to calculate the square of a number.

//! Intermediate Function Questions
//? 5. Write overloaded functions named print that print an integer, a double, and a string. Demonstrate the usage of these functions in main.

//? 6. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

//? 7. Write a function template for finding the maximum of two numbers. Use this template with different data types.

//? 8. What are function pointers? Write a simple program using a function pointer to call a function that adds two numbers.

//? 9. Explain what a lambda expression is in C++. Write a lambda function to add two numbers and call it.

//! Advanced Function Questions
//? 10. Explain what tail recursion is. Write a tail-recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

//? 11. What is a static variable inside a function? Write a function that uses a static variable to count how many times it has been called.

//? 12. Write a function that returns a pointer to the largest element in an array.

//? 13. Compare recursive and iterative solutions for calculating the Fibonacci series. Write both versions.

//? 14.Explain what a callback function is. Write a program that uses a callback function to process elements of an array.
